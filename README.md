This is just a thing because it's needed. A lot of distros struggle with fortune-mod, because it's maintainer have come under scrutiny and many find the datfiles full of overly probelmatic fortunes. The goal of this project isn't so succed fortune-mod, or create a historically accurate fortune program. It's to create on for people that just like random generate, curated, fortunes.

Fortunes are added from fortune-mod manually, from the `oldtunes` dir into the `fortunes` one. All fortunes have to be manually verified. The criteria for this is obviously an easy topic of bikeshedding, so [cafkafk](https://github.com/cafkafk)'s word is final.

I'll write this prettier later. It's in crates.io if you want it now, but it's rough and in `0.0.z`.
