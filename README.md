This project arose from a clear need. Many distributions face challenges with fortune-mod, primarily due to concerns about its maintainer and the presence of contentious fortunes in its data files. Rather than aiming to replace fortune-mod or develop a historically precise fortune program, our objective is to cater to those who appreciate curated, randomly generated fortunes.

We manually incorporate fortunes from fortune-mod, transferring them from the `oldtunes` directory to the `fortunes` directory. Each fortune undergoes a manual verification process. While the criteria for selection can be debated, cafkafk's judgment remains the final word.

A more polished description will be provided in due course. For those eager to explore, the preliminary 0.0.z version is available on crates.io.
